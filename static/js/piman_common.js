/* piman_edit("entity_type", "id") 
 *  This basically does an Ajax request to grab the CRUD form at /entity_type/id
 *  and shows it in a pop up - unsure how to implement this at the moment. Should
 *  it be an iframe so the back button works? Can you do that and toggle its
 *  visibility so it shows as an overlay without messing up the rest of the page 
 *  format?
